-----------------------------------------
### Inspiration

* After completing the Android course from Udacity, I wanted to make my own project in Android and if possible, publish it on Google Play Store.

* This app rose from the need of an application that can do the work of both a 'Reminder' as well as a 'Notes' app, has an intuitive UI and does not need internet.
